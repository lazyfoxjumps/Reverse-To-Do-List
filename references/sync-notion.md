# Notion Sync

After every successful local file write, mirror to a Notion database called "Reverse To-Do List." One page per day. The page properties make scores / categories queryable; the page body holds the human-readable entries and recap.

## Notion MCP tools used

These all share the registered Notion MCP prefix `mcp__fd70a912-79e2-477b-aa60-4d0caa13609b__`:

- `notion-search` — find parent pages, find today's existing day-page
- `notion-fetch` — read page or database details
- `notion-create-database` — first-log setup
- `notion-create-pages` — create today's day-page when it doesn't exist yet
- `notion-update-page` — update properties and body of an existing day-page

If those exact tool names aren't available in the current session, fall back to whatever Notion MCP tools ARE registered (the prefix may differ across installs). Match by suffix.

## First-log setup (one-time)

Triggered when `config.notion.database_id` is null.

1. **Find candidate parents.** Call `notion-search` with an empty query, filter to pages (not databases). Take the top 10-15 by recency.
2. **Ask the user.** Use `AskUserQuestion` with up to 4 of the most recent / most relevant pages as options, plus "Let me paste a page ID directly" as a fallback. The question: "Where in Notion should the 'Reverse To-Do List' database live?"
3. **Create the database.** Call `notion-create-database` under the chosen parent_page_id with this exact schema:

   | Property | Type | Notes |
   |----------|------|-------|
   | Name | title | Set to date string `YYYY-MM-DD` so the page title is the date |
   | Date | date | Same date, but as a queryable date property |
   | Total Score | number | |
   | Entry Count | number | |
   | Small Tasks | number | category subtotal |
   | Self-Care | number | category subtotal |
   | Emotional Stuffs | number | category subtotal |
   | Big Brain Hours | number | category subtotal |
   | Creative Time | number | category subtotal |
   | Rest | number | category subtotal |
   | Has Recap | checkbox | true once recap is written |

4. **Persist IDs.** Write the returned `database_id` and the chosen `parent_page_id` back into `config.json`. Do NOT lose them.
5. **Continue with the log** that triggered setup. The user shouldn't have to re-issue it.

If the user has zero Notion pages they want to use as parent, or cancels the question: set `config.notion.enabled: false` for this session, mention "Skipping Notion for now, you can re-enable in config.json later," and continue with local + Obsidian only.

## Every-log flow

1. **Find today's page.** Call `notion-search` scoped to the database (or query the database directly) for a page where `Date == today`.
2. **Create or update:**
   - If no page exists: call `notion-create-pages` with all properties set from the frontmatter, and the page body containing the entries list.
   - If a page exists: call `notion-update-page` to refresh the properties (Total Score, Entry Count, category subtotals), then replace the page body with the current entries list + recap (if present).
3. **Body format** (markdown-style, converted to Notion blocks by the MCP):

   ```
   ## Entries
   - 09:14 [self-care] Brushed teeth, took meds, 10
   - 09:40 [small tasks] Answered Avi's text, 8
   - 10:20 [big brain hours] Stared at ceiling re: funeral director school (20 min), 22

   ## Recap
   (recap text goes here when it exists)
   ```

   Do NOT use em-dashes or en-dashes (commas instead).

## Recap flow

Same as a log: search for today's page, update it. Set `Has Recap` checkbox to true. Replace the `## Recap` section in the body.

## Review flow

Reviews go in their own pages, **as child pages of the parent_page_id** (NOT inside the day-database). Naming:

- Weekly: title is `Week of YYYY-MM-DD` (week-end date)
- Monthly: title is `Month of YYYY-MM` (e.g. `Month of 2026-05`)

Create with `notion-create-pages`. Body = the full review markdown (intro, observations, receipts list, closing). No special properties needed.

## Failure handling

If any Notion call fails (network, auth, rate limit, MCP not connected):

1. Skip silently. Do NOT crash, do NOT block the local log.
2. Set an in-memory flag for this session. In the next confirmation, mention once: "FYI, Notion sync failed this time, local + Obsidian still wrote. I'll try again next log."
3. On subsequent logs in the same session, retry Notion. If it works, great. If it keeps failing, don't keep mentioning it (mention once per session, max).

## When sync is disabled

If `config.notion.enabled: false`, skip entirely. The user opted out.

## Concurrency note

If the user logs two entries within a second (rare but possible), the second update might overwrite the first if Notion hasn't propagated yet. Accept this tradeoff for v1.5. The local file is always correct; Notion is a mirror. Worst case the next log re-syncs everything from the local file.
